The turn of the year, the "magical change" we all expect. 
2020 is gone and all the things I was to do remain to do.
Familiar sounds for days that pile on top of each other.  
"I won't do anymore."

### Tracklist
{% for track in site.data.playlists.yanohares %}
<div class="tracklist">
    <img class="track-image" src="{{ track.image }}" />
    <p class="track-title">{{ track.title }}</p>
    <p class="track-artist">{{ track.artist }}</p>
</div>
{% endfor %}
