**111 days**.

That’s how much I’ve spent in lockdown. Going out once or twice a week just to get the essentials.

I suppose like most of the fortunate ones I’ve gone through all the quarantine stages. I caught up with the reading list, ran out of Seinfeld episodes to re-rewatch, escaped cofinement through melted walls and enjoyed the privilege of comfort in these times.

I stopped complaining and entered a lethargic state filled with uncertainty.
