I'm <span class="highlight">@`kandr3s`</span>, a Colombian programmer that lives a minimalist life, owning only essential stuff and using open source [tools](/tools). 

I studied journalism and computer science but haven't received a college degree. I've worked in gold mines, retail, warehouses, call centers, online publications and writing code. I consider myself an autodidact as I've become this person thanks to curiosity, love for learning and being fortunate enough to have grown up with a screen connected to the Internet.
