title: Tools I Use

I'm a privacy, self-hosting and free open source software enthusiast. When using software or online services, unless unpractical, I always go with the open source and privacy-respecting option. "Free" is negotiable (I'm no Stallman ðŸ˜…), I think that if affordable one should always pay for essential apps even if they're free.

Here's the stuff I use for work and entertainment.

### Desktop
* CPU: AMD A8-7650K Radeon R7
* Speakers: Pioneer SP-BS22-LR
* DAC: TOPPING D30 DSD USB DAC

### On Mobile
* iPhone SE
* IEMs: BLON BL03
* Speakers: JBL GO 2

#### Software & Services
* Manjaro Linux
* Firefox
* Tutanota
* Visual Studio Code
* Signal
* Beets
* Tauon Music Box
* Foliate
* VLC
* Bitwarden
* Eddie
* FreeTube
* Fluent Reader
* Musicbrainz
* Listenbrainz
* Jellyfin

#### Not-Open
* Notion
* GitHub
* Reddit
* Twitter
* Discord
* Spotify
* WhatsApp (How does one get rid of Facebook?)

If there's something you want me to try or recommend me just [write](/contact).
