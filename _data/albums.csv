"2020-01-01","11423","Kevin Ayers","Joy of a Toy","1969","6","n","Lo que me resulta admirable del trabajo de Kevin Ayers es su habilidad innata para crear algo puramente autentico y artístico. Siendo si mismo y absorto en ideas propias que distaban del trabajo similarmente destacado pero grupal que con Soft Machine había realizado en años anteriores, Ayers nos entrega una obra exquisitamente original.

El album, desde su caratula misma destila un aire de circo, y Joy of a Toy Continued, la canción que abre -originalmente titulada “Circus”- alimenta esta idea con una inquietante flauta y coros inspirados en el folklore medieval. Partiendo de este concepto, Kevin Ayers entrega al publico fábulas con aire fantástico ligadas a melodías pop pegadizas que desafortunadamente nunca se mateliarizarian en la admiración y aclamación popular.

[b]Temas favoritos:[/b] Town Feeling, Stop This Train y Lady Rachel."

"2020-01-01","4052","Comus","First Utterance","1971","9","n","Realmente no sé que estaba pasando en las mentes detrás de First Utterance, pero a juzgar por el contenido crudo de sus letras, que hablan de violaciones, necrofilia, y otras acciones convencionalmente inhumanas; me imagino que tenían sus problemas, por decir muy poco. Pero las mismas mentes lograron crear este cuento de terror del folclor medieval. Y aunque las letras son inquietantes y oscuras, la música es surrealista, relajante y emocionante por momentos. No llamaría a esto un álbum, lo llamaría un cuento popular, un mito."

"2020-01-01","1981","Marillion","Clutching at Straws","1987","6","n","The album cover bleeds 80’s, the good kind of 80’s though, it doesn’t only sets a tone but also, to an extent, a location for several of the songs. One might say it’s a Tom Waits-esque scenario, not only because of the Noir influenced colors but more because of the lyrics. This is an album about loneliness, depression and addictions that doesn’t sound sad or isolated, which is the common factor in albums that deal with these situations. It is also the last album with Fish as Marillion’s leader, this has given the album biased reviews but I think this is the band’s best record by a small stretch, although it’s true that Misplaced Childhood gets more recognition and works better as an introductory piece to the band’s catalog, I find Clutching at Straws to be more daring. Prove of this is the risks they took with songs like Incommunicado and Going Under which are closer to 80’s pop than to their distinctive flavor of progressive rock."

"2020-01-01","12852","Lee Hazlewood","Cowboy in Sweden","1970","8","n","El año es 1966, y el ya legendario Frank Sinatra busca dar inicio a la carrera musical de su hija Nancy, para esto, recluta al compositor y productor Lee Hazlewood, quien daría luz a uno de los más grandes éxitos populares de la década de los sesentas These Boots Are Made for Walkin’ de Nancy Sinatra.

El apabullante éxito de Boots le daría a Hazlewood fondos suficientes para crear su propio sello discográfico y llevar una vida de comodidades.

Cuatro años más tarde, después del fracaso comercial de su sello, Hazlewood dejaría los Estados Unidos para ubicarse definitivamente en Suecia, país donde ya había trabajado como actor en proyectos del director Torbjörn Axelman-. Regresaría al país escandinavo para poner en marcha un nuevo proyecto audiovisual del mismo cineasta, dando así vida a Cowboy in Sweden (Vaquero en Suecia), más que una película convencional, era realmente una selección de escenas de Hazlewood cabalgando en paisajes suecos con sus canciones de fondo, pero que dejaría una joya artística en su album del mismo nombre.

“Vaquero en Suecia” como título fija un escenario contradictorio. La imagen del cowboy es en esencia la del hombre ganadero en países como Estados Unidos y Canadá, y esta evoca consigo el desierto de Texas y el lejano oeste popularizado en el cine western. Es difícil entonces imaginarse a un vaquero en los paisajes sombríos y helados de Escandinavia.

Es sin embargo en ese escenario surreal que Hazlewood crea una obra singularmente psicodélica y brumosa, que se erigiría como opera magna en su carrera como solista. Se trata de una mezcla exquisita de melodías barrocas con tintes de folk psicodélico que por una parte relata romances problemáticos que cobran vida en los duetos con Nina Lizell en Leather & Lace y la seductora Hey, Cowboy.

Y por otra parte expresa con letras introspectivas y melancólicas, la ansiedad existencial y los sentimientos de crudeza en el mundo en temas como Cool Hard Times

[i]Escuché que mi hermano murió la semana pasada
de una sobredosis de odio inyectada en sus venas
Escuché que el predicador dijo que Dios debe tener sentido del humor
porque cuando lo pusieron en la tumba, ni siquiera llovió[/i]

Haciendo referencia con estas no solo a la crueldad y daño causado por la adicción a las drogas, si no que también cuestiona el sentido y la relevancia de la vida misma.

Mientras que en Pray Them Bars Away, –un blues a los encarcelados que recuerda a At Folsom Prison, el mítico álbum de Johnny Cash– Hazlewood indaga en los sentimientos de un preso que enfrenta la realidad: su vida ahora consiste en rejas y muros, su preciada libertad ha escapado.

[i]Cuatro años ya, y veintiuno más
Aún faltan diez mil desayunos
Y catorce millones de segundos viviendo así
Es hora de empezar a rezar para que se vayan estas rejas[/i]

Cowboy in Sweden, el disco, es una obra que le dio a la música Country un muy necesitado nuevo aire, elevando el género a su estado más artístico con diligentes arreglos orquestales, romance y filosofía."

"2020-01-01","8335","Tim Buckley","Happy Sad","1969","10","n","Tim Buckley’s &#34;Happy Sad&#34; is an album that judged upon instrumental interpretations alone stands on its own as an excellent record. But the addition of Tim’s resonant vocal performances make it a true masterpiece of the genre. And even though it’s hard to grasp exactly what genres it belongs to it’s safe to settle somewhere between jazz and psychedelic folk. This is a record that without attempting to brings peace and tranquility, which is something that results from the well placed effects, the versatility of the singer and the melancholic lyrics. When every little piece of “Happy Sad“ comes together so beautifully it charms you and that’s exactly what makes it one of my all time favorite records."
